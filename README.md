### Building Scalable Digital Experiences for 20+ Years

From migrating legacy architectures to Laravel for **Complex Media** (40+ sites) to designing Node.js delivery layers for **Google AMP** at scale, I specialize in building web systems that are as performant as they are maintainable.

- 🏗 **Currently:** Building **[Open Source Quest](https://www.opensourcequest.com)** and architecting specialized SaaS solutions at **[Med2Go](https://www.med2go.io)**.
- 🚀 **Past:** Led modernization efforts for **NY Mag**, **WSJ**, and **Complex Media**.
- 🧠 **Interests:** Local AI/LLM infrastructure (`ollama.cpp`), frontend performance, and technical mentorship.
